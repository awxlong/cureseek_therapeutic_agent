[1]\n\n[FinalAnswer] B: 'TRYNGOLZA with dose adjustment due to renal impairment'. \n\nThe patient is a 70-year-old male with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), presenting with memory issues, recurrent pancreatitis, and mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 mL/min). TRYNGOLZA (Olezarsen Sodium) is indicated for the treatment of FCS. Given the patient's renal impairment, it is crucial to adjust the dose of TRYNGOLZA to ensure safety and efficacy. Option B, which involves dose adjustment due to renal impairment, is the most suitable treatment option for this patient. This choice takes into account the patient's renal function and the need for careful dosing to avoid potential adverse effects. [2]",
