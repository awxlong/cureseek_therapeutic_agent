Exclusion criteria included a history of malignancy, other systemic comorbidities, chronic metabolic or infectious diseases, and prior treatment with drugs potentially affecting ocular function. For each patient, informed written consent was obtained from parents or caregivers, authorizing the anonymous use of clinical data for research purposes. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 [ 11 ]. 2.2. Data Collection During the ophthalmological and pediatric evaluation, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and disease-related variables were collected, including sex, age at pSS diagnosis, and disease duration at the time of the ophthalmological examination. Each patient completed a symptom questionnaire [ 12 ] about their symptoms, and a complete eye examination was then performed on all patients. The diagnosis and classification of keratoconjunctivitis sicca were based on the detection of qualitative and quantitative alterations of the tear film and the evidence of ocular surface damage, assessed by slit-lamp examination and specific tests, including tear break-up time (TBUT) and Schirmer\u2019s test, according to the Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) criteria [ 13 ]. Schirmer\u2019s test I (without anesthesia) was performed by placing standardized Whatman filter paper strips in the lateral third of the lower eyelid fornix of both eyes.

When the parotid gland sonography was performed, it showed enlarged glands bilaterally, in association with hypoechoic lesions and reticulocyte bands (Fig. 2 ). The pelvis and bilateral renal ultrasound were normal. Figure 2. Parotid gland US: enlarged gland, with hypoechoic lesions and reticulocyte bands. She was evaluated 3 times at the ophthalmology clinic, and lubricant eye drops were prescribed. On the third visit, uveitis was found incidentally with iridocyclitis and optic disc swelling. A Schirmer test was not done, as the patient was not cooperative. A minor salivary gland biopsy was taken and showed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis and squamous mucosa with mild parakeratosis (Fig. 3 ). Figure 3.

Such an untangling of cause and effect becomes even more complicated in patients comorbid for diseases that present together frequently: diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, obesity. A few reviews of the literature speak to the modest ability of these inhibitors to lower blood pressure. 66\u201368 Endothelin Antagonists : Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent pro-hypertensive agent and effects most of its actions through the GPCRs ET A and ET B . Aprocitentan, a dual ET A and ET B receptor antagonist, appears to have struck the optimal balance of blockade of these two receptors (16:1 for A vs. B). The PRECISION clinical trials support the use of this antagonist for resistant hypertension. 69 Xu et al . 70 review ET-1 and ET receptors in the context of aprocitentan. Interestingly, evidence exists that ET receptors possess biased signaling 71 but it is not known if drugs like aprocitentan take advantage of these new receptor modalities. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS Receptor theory evolves and continues to do so along-side antihypertensive drug development. There is a seeming advantage to use these new theories in the deliberate development of novel antihypertensives. The existence of the three R\u2019s\u2014regression, resistance, and refractoriness demands new developments. While this review does not cover potential new classes of therapeutics (antibodies, RNA therapies, non-pharmacologic, etc.), it provides evidence that there is room within the small molecule world to develop new therapeutics that act with new mechanisms.\n--- Passage 2 from Article ID: 38150382 ---\nThe readers of this journal have been and are the force to treat the disease of hypertension. It has been for only ~120 years that high blood pressure has been recognized as a clinically meaningful finding, as determined by insurance and actuarial companies. 1 Further, at least some in the medical community were skeptical of the necessity to treat hypertension. The following quote is attributed to Dr. Paul Dudley White, an important Boston Cardiologist: \u201cHypertension may be an important compensatory mechanism which should not be tampered with, even were it certain that we could control it.\u201d 2 Significant research that started in the 1940s identified that control of blood pressure was key to extending lifespan. Myriad treatments have been used, including surgical interventions. Pharmacology, however, provides a versatile, less invasive means by which to treat the life-long problem of hypertension. The use of pharmaceutics in the treatment of hypertension began with the success of the compound tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) to reduce blood pressure. 3 This quaternary ammonium salt was recognized to inhibit the transmission of nerve impulses. Injected intravenously, it reduced arterial pressure. The first successful (oral) agent to treat hypertension was chlorothiazide as a diuretic, in 1957. 4 This drug is still used today. Figure 1 presents a \u201cwork in progress\u201d timeline for antihypertensive medications, many of which are described below. It shares either specific drugs or drug classes. The empty boxes are present for reasons also discussed below. As shown in Figure 1 , the discovery of antihypertensive medications was extensive in the 1950s\u20131970s\n--- Passage 3 from Article ID: 38150382 ---\ncardiovascular system. 56 For the more recently approved MR antagonists, finerenone, mechanistic, and preclinical studies show a unique inverse agonist activity for finerenone vs. eplerenone. 57 In addition, there may be biased recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors. With respect to clinical significance, there were differences between eplerenone and finerenone on the development of cardiac fibrosis after isoproterenol infusion. Both MR antagonists significantly inhibited the isoproterenol-mediated increase in left ventricular mass. However, isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation were blocked by finerenone, whereas, eplerenone had no significant effect. Whether either the inverse agonism or co-factor recruitment bias is the mechanism of this unique benefit of finerenone should be assessed in further studies. 5. Dopamine receptor agonists This is a niche class of antihypertensive drugs. FDA-Approved Drugs : fenoldopam. Primary Mechanism of Action: Fenoldopam\u2019s use has been largely restricted to hypertensive crises. 58 Its mechanism is somewhat unique in that it activates dopamine D 1 receptors that reduce vascular resistance primarily in the kidneys. The D 1 receptor is a GPCR. New Mechanisms of Action: Evidence suggests that the D 1 receptor can act in a biased fashion, and that fenoldopam may be somewhat \u03b2-biased. 59 WHY NEW ANTIHYPERTENSIVES? The sheer fact that resistant and, more so, refractory hypertension exists is evidence that new drugs for the treatment of hypertension need to be discovered and brought to the clinic. 27 , 28 All the pathways described above cannot be the totality of means by which blood pressure is regulated.

Treatment of patients with milder symptoms that occur intermittently may be treated with nonpharmacological therapy but when not successful, drug therapy should be chosen based on the timing of the symptoms and the needs of the patient. Patients with moderate to severe RLS typically require daily medication to control their symptoms. Although the dopamine agonists, ropinirole and pramipexole have been the drugs of choice for patients with moderate to severe RLS, drug emergent problems like augmentation may limit their use for long term therapy. Keeping the dopamine agonist dose as low as possible, using longer acting dopamine agonists such as the rotigotine patch and maintaining a high serum ferritin level may help prevent the development of augmentation. The \u03b12\u03b4 anticonvulsants may now also be considered as drugs of choice for moderate to severe RLS patients. Opioids should be considered for RLS patients, especially for those who have failed other therapies since they are very effective for severe cases. When monitored appropriately, they can be very safe and durable for long term therapy. They should also be strongly considered for treating patients with augmentation as they are very effective for relieving the worsening symptoms that occur when decreasing or eliminating dopamine agonists.

{"id": "0STp1RL1Qnen", "augmented_context": "[RELEVANT PASSAGES FROM LITERATURE]\n--- Passage 1 from Article ID: 39669300 ---\nIntroduction Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most prevalent clinical complication in the pregnancy-postpartum cycle, representing a significant public health concern, with a substantial increase in its prevalence over the past decades. GDM affects approximately 16.5% of pregnancies worldwide, and this number is expected to rise with the increasing obesity epidemic. The combination of diabetes and pregnancy without adequate metabolic control can be associated with adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes, such as the possibility of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, and fetal birth injuries. In an effort to prevent adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes, the initial therapeutic approach for GDM includes nutritional guidance and regular physical activity. However, some pregnant women are unable to manage this disorder solely through lifestyle changes, necessitating the use of medications. Insulin is currently considered the gold standard for achieving euglycemia in pregnant women. Metformin, a first-line medication for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, can be administered in specific situations, such as when obtaining a glucometer or insulin is impossible, when a pregnant woman is already using 100 international units (IU) of insulin and metformin needs to be added, and when she is unable to correctly use insulin. This drug has been recognized as a viable alternative to insulin therapy for GDM. ( 1 \u2013 6 ) Metformin is a biguanide that reduces gluconeogenesis in the liver and stimulates glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. ( 7 ) It reduces both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose. Besides, it does not induce hypoglycemia and it is not associated with\n--- Passage 2 from Article ID: 39669300 ---\nand postprandial plasma glucose. Besides, it does not induce hypoglycemia and it is not associated with increased weight gain. ( 8 ) Different from insulin which requires an insulin-antibody complex to cross the placental barrier, metformin can freely traverse the placenta and circulate in the foetus. ( 9 , 10 ) Despite that, there is no evidence of adverse fetal effects or increased risk of major malformations when metformin is used in pregnant women. ( 8 ) Patients initiating metformin treatment may experiencing mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. These may encompass diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, nausea, and occasionally, a metallic taste in the mouth. These symptoms tend to correlate with the dosage and typically improve if the dosage is decreased. ( 11 ) Metformin is contraindicated when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min. Moreover, metformin prescription should be carefully done in patients with acute heart failure, especially when there is hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Metformin seems to be safe for patients with stable compensated heart failure and sufficient end-organ perfusion. The FDA label also expresses worries about metformin-triggered lactic acidosis in liver failure, potentially due to hindered lactate clearance. ( 12 ) There is still debate regarding the therapeutic equivalence between metformin and insulin in the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus. Hence, the need arose to conduct a Systematic Review on the topic to consolidate the benefits and drawbacks, assessing both maternal and neonatal outcomes. To achieve this, we defined the primary outcomes for study as: birth weight, mode of delivery, need for neonatal intensive care\n--- Passage 3 from Article ID: 39744260 ---\nIntroduction Urinary tract infections are a common perinatal complication, affecting approximately 8% of pregnancies [ 1 ], ranging from asymptomatic bacteriuria to pyelonephritis. Approximately 1-2% of pregnancies are complicated by bacterial pyelonephritis, with recurrence occurring in 20-25% of cases during pregnancy [ 1 , 2 ]. Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, acute necrotizing infection characterized by gas retention in the renal pelvis, renal parenchyma, and perirenal tissue, with a mortality rate of approximately 25% [ 3 ]. About 95% of EPN cases are associated with diabetes mellitus, and 25-75% with urinary tract obstruction [ 4 , 5 ]. Huang's severity classification determines treatment for EPN, and in addition to intravenous antibiotics, invasive procedures such as percutaneous drainage or nephrectomy may be required in severe cases [ 3 , 5 ]. However, there are few reports of EPN during pregnancy, and treatment strategies are not well-defined. Here, we report a case of EPN at 29 weeks of pregnancy. Case presentation A 32-year-old primigravida woman was referred to our hospital at nine weeks of gestation with complications including type 2 diabetes mellitus, a history of pyelonephritis before pregnancy, and obesity (non-pregnant body mass index: 35 kg/m 2 ). She had been treated with anti-diabetic medications (metformin hydrochloride 500 mg/day and dapagliflozin propylene glycolate hydrate 10 mg/day) before her pregnancy. When she became pregnant, she stopped her diabetic medications and switched to insulin therapy. The patient was initiated on insulin detemir at a dose of 7 units/day and insulin aspart at 38 units/day at eight weeks of gestation.\n"}

Chorioamnionitis was treated aggressively with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. The second case was a 22-year-old female, also in her first pregnancy, who underwent routine sexually transmitted-infections screening at 36 weeks, testing negative for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae but positive for Mpox from a vaginal swab. At 38 weeks and 4 days, labor was induced due to oligohydramnios, which followed 48 h of fluid leakage. Similar to the first case, she developed chorioamnionitis during labor, which was induced with an oxytocin infusion. The treatment for chorioamnionitis mirrored that of the first case, with a regimen of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. Both cases illustrate the complexities of managing pregnant individuals with Mpox, especially when coupled with obstetric complications like intrahepatic cholestasis, oligohydramnios, and chorioamnionitis. The management strategies involved not only addressing the Mpox infection but also carefully navigating pregnancy complications to ensure the health and safety of both the mother and the fetus. Indeed, the use of antivirals like tecovirimat and vaccinia immune globulin in pregnant women may give rise to obstetric issues, such as the potential for a prolonged QT interval when corrected for heart rate, errors in measuring blood glucose levels, and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism caused by medical interventions. Finally, Dung et al. [ 49 ] reported two women, who traveled from the United Arab Emirates to Vietnam, diagnosed with Mpox, hospitalized, and linked to a newer, emerging sub-lineage, A.2.1 (Clade IIb), differing from the B.1 lineage\n--- Passage 2 from Article ID: 38543691 ---\nthe spread and management of Mpox within Africa and worldwide, especially in a socially vulnerable, highly stigmatized population, namely the community of sex workers. The patient began experiencing a fever and, four days after her last sexual encounter with a client in a brothel, developed vesiculopustular lesions on her groin and genital area. Sampson et al. [ 47 ] presented a case of a 20-year-old pregnant woman at 31 weeks of gestation, with a history of sexually transmitted infections but no chronic conditions. She sought medical attention due to vaginal discharge, bleeding, painful urination, and decreased fetal movements for two weeks. At the genital exam, she presented with a new painful vaginal lesion (a 1 cm labial ulcer, affecting her left labia majora ) and a subsequent herpes-like papular rash on her abdomen and leg at 31 weeks of gestation, along with tender lymph nodes in her left groin. She was admitted for a suspected urinary tract infection and fetal observation. Previously, she had been treated for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and pyelonephritis during her pregnancy. Initial screenings for HIV and syphilis were negative. Upon admission, she showed signs of tachycardia but no fever or high blood pressure, and fetal monitoring was normal. During the hospital stay, the vaginal lesion grew, accompanied by new, itchy, red lesions on her body. Six days after, she mentioned her partner had recently tested positive for Mpox and, on the seventh day, PCR tests confirmed her vaginal lesion was positive for Orthopoxvirus, while also indicating herpes simplex virus 1, suggesting viral shedding\n--- Passage 3 from Article ID: 38543691 ---\nvaginal lesion was positive for Orthopoxvirus, while also indicating herpes simplex virus 1, suggesting viral shedding rather than the cause of the ulcer. After being diagnosed with Mpox infection and herpes co-infection, she was treated with tecovirimat and acyclovir. Her condition stabilized, with no new lesions, allowing for her discharge and for her to complete the tecovirimat treatment at home. Her lesions resolved 10 days after starting treatment. She had an uncomplicated induction of labor at 39 and 2/7 weeks of gestation and delivered a healthy neonate, who, despite reporting a temporary lesion on the scalp and having a positive immunoglobulin G test result for Orthopoxvirus, did not have skin lesions or positive molecular test results on the cord blood, fetal serum, maternal vaginal fluid, and the placenta\u2019s surface that were suggestive of an infection. The baby remained healthy and developed normally at the three-month follow-up. Renfro et al. [ 48 ] reported two cases of Mpox infection in pregnant, heterosexual cisgender women, focusing on their pregnancy and childbirth outcomes. Both women underwent labor induction and encountered complications from chorioamnionitis during childbirth. The first case is a 19-year-old female, in her first pregnancy, who experienced vaginal itching at 24 weeks of gestation. She tested negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but positive for Mpox from a vaginal swab. At 36 weeks, labor was induced due to intrahepatic cholestasis: during labor, she developed chorioamnionitis. Initial treatment for the presumed vaginitis included topical metronidazole, and labor was induced using a Cook balloon and an oxytocin infusion. Chorioamnionitis\n"}
